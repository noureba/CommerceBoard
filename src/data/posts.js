    content: `Web development is constantly evolving, driven by new technologies, frameworks, and user expectations. In recent years, we've seen a major shift toward serverless architecture, micro-frontends, and increased emphasis on performance and accessibility.
  
  Modern developers are now expected to be familiar with a wide range of tools — from frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte to backend services like Firebase, Supabase, and serverless functions on Vercel or AWS.
  
  Looking ahead, AI-assisted development, WebAssembly, and progressive web apps (PWAs) are likely to play an even more important role in shaping how we build and interact with web apps.
  
  To stay relevant, developers must commit to continuous learning and experimentation.`,

    status: "Published",
    content: `React continues to dominate the frontend landscape. With the introduction of React Server Components, Suspense, and concurrent rendering, developers can now build faster and more scalable applications.
  
  To master React in 2025, you should understand:
  - Component design patterns (HOCs, Render Props, Hooks)
  - Context API and Redux Toolkit for state management
  - React Router for client-side routing
  - Performance optimization techniques like memoization, code splitting, and lazy loading
  
  It’s also essential to adopt TypeScript and modern bundlers like Vite or Webpack 5 to improve your development workflow. Finally, always prioritize accessibility and responsive design in every React app you build.`,

    status: "Draft",
    content: `Scalable UI systems require more than just reusable components — they need design consistency, flexibility, and strong documentation. A good UI system helps teams move faster and maintain a unified product look and feel across the board.
  
  Tools like Storybook, Figma, and component libraries (e.g., Chakra UI, Tailwind UI, Material UI) can be used to manage and test your design system.
  
  Key practices include:
  - Creating atomic design structures
  - Naming conventions that scale
  - Documentation-first development
  - Regular audits and refactoring
  
  A design system is a living thing. It should grow with your product, your users, and your team.`,

    status: "Published",
    content: `Clean code is about more than aesthetics — it directly affects maintainability, scalability, and collaboration. Some of the key principles include:
  
  - Naming variables and functions clearly
  - Keeping functions short and focused
  - Avoiding deep nesting and side effects
  - Using consistent formatting and linting tools (e.g., Prettier, ESLint)
  - Writing tests that describe behavior, not implementation
  
  Remember, code is read more often than it is written. Writing clean code today saves countless hours tomorrow.`,

    category: "Architecture",
    status: "Published",
    content: `State management becomes challenging as applications grow. You should decide between local, global, and server state early on to avoid tight coupling and complexity.
  
  Popular approaches:
  - Local state: useState, useReducer
  - Global state: Context API, Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai
  - Server state: React Query, SWR
  
  Also, structure your code into clear domains or modules, and consider lazy loading state-heavy modules. This way, your app remains fast and organized even as features expand.`,
